A simple and interactive loss function visualizer for machine learning tasks using Plotly.
Ideal for visualizing the model learning process.

Tasks to work on,
- Determining Convex Functions
- Generalizing gradient descent to non-differentiable functions (LASSO)
- Much more easy to integrate into code or jupyter file
